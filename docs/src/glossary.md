number of types, but is data that should be immutable (i.e. left
unchanged) and stored safely in the [_evidence
package_](#evidence-package).

#### evidence package

The file type that EvidenceAngel works with: a bundle of evidence,
stored as a collection of [_test cases_](#test-case).

#### test case

A smaller collection of evidence, specific to a single run of a test
case.
