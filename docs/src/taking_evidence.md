that need emphasis.

**HTTP Request**: a separated request/response field for tidier formatting of
web requests.

**Image**: an image, embedded into the _test case_.

## Manipulating Evidence

You can also reorder evidence by drag-and-drop, or by clicking the arrow in the
top right of the evidence and selecting "Move Up" or "Move Down". You can also
delete evidence from this menu.
