# Exporting Evidence

One of the key benefits to using EvidenceAngel is that
[_evidence packages_](./glossary.md#evidence-package) and
[_test cases_](./glossary.md#test-case) can be exported to common formats for
other people to view the data. This means that not everyone who might need to
review the evidence needs to have EvidenceAngel.

To export data:

Note: when exporting, the _evidence package_ will be automatically saved if
needed!

1. Select the main menu.
