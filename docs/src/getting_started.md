# Getting Started

Welcome to EvidenceAngel, a tool in the Angel-suite which enhances the process
of taking evidence in manual and automatic testing.

## Why EvidenceAngel?

When taking evidence in a format that is sharable and can be annotated, using a
spreadsheet is helpful because it provides a tabbed way without page breaks to
store images, files and text. However, it is annoying to have to style things
and keep the document organised. EvidenceAngel solves this problem, by allowing
these types of data to be stored in bundles with test cases, without having to
worry about styling. And don't worry, you can export the data into formats that
can be easily shared!

EvidenceAngel, as with everyone using the same terminology it makes it easier to
